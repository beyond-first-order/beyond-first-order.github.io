## Important Dates
- Deadline for paper submission: September 22, Anywhere On Earth (AOE)
- Notification of acceptance:    October 20, AOE
- Camera-ready submission date:  TBD, AOE
- Workshop date:                 TBD, CDT


## Submission information

Some examples of acceptable topics include:
- All higher-order optimizers,
- Adaptive gradient methods,
- Novel higher-order-friendly models,
- Higher-order theory papers,
- Quasi Newton methods,
- and many more.

If a submission does not fall into one of the above topics, but is still related to higher-order optimization, we encourage its submission. "Beating" Adam / SGD is not a requirement, but we do expect fair apples-to-apples comparison to related higher-order optimizers (if applicable).

### Submission process itself is TBD, stay tuned.
