## Important Dates
- Deadline for paper submission: September 22, Anywhere On Earth (AOE)
- Notification of acceptance:    October 20, AOE
- Camera-ready submission date:  TBD, AOE
- Workshop date:                 December 2nd, 2022


## Submission Information

Some examples of acceptable topics include:
- All higher-order optimizers,
- Adaptive gradient methods,
- Novel higher-order-friendly models,
- Higher-order theory papers,
- Quasi Newton methods,
- and many more.

If a submission does not fall into one of the above topics, but is still related to higher-order optimization, we encourage its submission. "Beating" Adam / SGD is not a requirement, but we do expect fair apples-to-apples comparison to related higher-order optimizers (if applicable).

For submission formatting, please use the HOO-2022 Style Files. These files can be downloaded [**HERE**](https://order-up-ml.github.io/style.zip). We ask all papers be limited to 5 pages (before references) and be submitted anonymized.

**There will be a best paper / best poster prize!**

## Submission Process

Please use our CMT submission portal which can be found at the following link: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/HOOML2022.

## Dual Submission Policy

We will not accept submissions that have already been accepted for publication in other venues with archival proceedings (including publications that will be presented at the NeurIPS main conference). We discourage dual submission to concurrent NeurIPS workshops. Extended abstracts of papers under review at other conferences/journals can be submitted if this is ok for the conference/journal in question (if in doubt, please check with them first). Accepted papers will be posted on the webpage, but the workshop does not have archival proceedings.
